rexify.py

Prepare an OpenType font for use with ReX.  Rexify will look for glyphs that
are not accessible from a CMAP, place those glyphs into a Private Usage Area
and modify the CMAPs to include these glyphs.  This is necessary for when
you want to render math in SVG by referring to glyphs from their usv.
